\subsection{Related Work}
\citet{Redington1998} uncovered evidence that suggests that in human learning ``syntactical categories can be obtained from distributional information alone.''  They support this hypothesis by using ``link clustering'' to hierarchically cluster words using a high dimensional feature space representation of each word.  The feature space representation they use is the concatenation of the forward and backward bigram predictive probability distributions.   They show ``dendograms'' (tree ontologies) that relate
